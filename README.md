# Pick 2 out of 3
A super simple implementation of the classic "Pick 2 out of 3" switches which
randomly disables one of the two switches already-enabled switches when you try to enable the third.

This was coded up in ~30 minutes with Claude AI doing most of the work, so don't expect anything super high quality.
